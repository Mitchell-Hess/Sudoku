# Sudoku-Solver
This C++ program utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve any 9x9 sudoku puzzle or determine if a puzzle cannot be solved.

I developed this program in December 2021 to strengthen my understanding of backtracking algorithms and introduce me into
puzzle-solving in general. I plan to add a GUI to this program in the future and transform the program into a sudkodu player 
with a solver attached.
